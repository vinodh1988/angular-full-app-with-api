create array of 10 projects object in the api.json file with
this object structure
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Project 1",
  "description": "Project 1 description",
  "status": "active",
  "startDate": "2021-01-01",
  "endDate": "2021-01-31",
  "teamSize": 10,
  "image":"x.jpg"
}

re run the json server

in the Api service add function to consume the projects endpoint

in the projects page display 
all the project details

Follow the same approach that we followed for the services
